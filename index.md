## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pic.jpg">

I'm a Bitcoin programmer âš¡

## BUIDL Bootcamp

I run [BUIDL Bootcamp](https://buidlbootcamp.com), the first Bitcoin programming bootcamp. 

Videos from our October 2018 cohort are available [free on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ56Yiu6lEaxIPm9-GB5M393CmtYRZFGY).

## Bits & Bolts

[Bits & Bolts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ56Yiu6lEaw-oXyEnSjdLfqZSbWv2rrl) is a YouTube show about people building on Bitcoin. Since starting BUIDL Bootcamp I haven't had as much time to work on it as I want, but hopefully I will find time in the future.
